With over 10 years in the IT industry, I am passionate about Web technologies and the art of programming. That, together with my eclectic range of interests, has laid the groundwork for my career and my education abroad, and it has ultimately led to extensive experience in some of the most interesting areas of software development.

In my work, I focus on ensuring a high standard of usability, functionality, and overall code quality. My specialities are Web Development, Standards-Based Web Design, Progressive Web App, Mobile Development. I am up to date with trending technologies such as ReactJS, React Native, TypeScript, NodeJS, GraphQL and I always keep myself informed, anticipating ‘the next big thing’.

I hold myself to a high standard of quality in everything that I do and believe Agile methodologies and Test-Driven Development (TDD) lead to better applications.
