[Refcard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reference_card) is a collection of brief notes on a specific topic to aid in memorization.

I have found a few useful refcards on the [DZone](https://dzone.com/refcardz) website.
I have listed here just the popular ones and the ones I'm interested in. You can find out more on the official website.

## Functional Programming in JavaScript
**The Functional Paradigm in a Familiar Language**

Explains functions, data types, and techniques to demonstrate the functional paradigm through the familiar JavaScript language.

## Functional Programming with Clojure
**Simple Concurrency on the JVM**

Clojure is a robust, practical, and fast programming language with a set of useful features that together form a simple, coherent, and powerful tool.

## Understanding Cloud Computing
**Amazon EC2, Google App Engine, and Microsoft Azure**

This Refcard will walk you through the basics, from where exactly clouds are located, to deciphering the differences between cloud service types (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS), and the key benefits you can expect to receive.

## Design systems
The importance of UX is exponentially growing, which means that collaboration between design and development teams is a must. Design systems help foster this collaboration. In this Refcard, you’ll learn about the four stages of design-development collaboration, the anatomy of a design system, the benefits of using a design system, and the future of design systems.

## Getting Started With Docker
**The De Facto Open-Source Containerization Solution**

In what seems like an instant, Docker has become the benchmark for organizations to automate infrastructure, isolate applications, maintain consistency, and improve resource utilizations. In this Refcard, learn how to run a container, explore several useful commands, and discover how to create local Docker machines.

## Getting Started With Microservices
**Design Patterns for Decomposing the Monolith**

Welcome to the world of microservices, where continuous deployment isn’t just an aspiration, but a reality. With microservices, you can ditch the complexities of monolithic architecture for the nimble and flexible approach that embraces the “do one thing, and do it well” mentality. In this article, you will learn key characteristics and benefits of microservices, as well as common patterns to help you get started.

## Node.js
**Server-Side JavaScript for Backends, API Servers, and Web Apps**

Node.js is a JavaScript runtime that runs on top of Google’s open-source JavaScript engine called V8. Pairing JavaScript’s naturally event-driven, asynchronous coding style with non-blocking I/O libraries makes Node.js fast, lightweight, and efficient. This article introduces Node, explains how it works, and dives into its architecture. Learn how to install and use Node to its full potential and access a list of the most commonly used APIs.
