[Refcard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reference_card) is a collection of brief notes on a specific topic to aid in memorization.

I have found a few useful refcards on the [DZone](https://dzone.com/refcardz) website.
I have listed here just the popular ones and the ones I'm interested in. You can find out more on the official website.
