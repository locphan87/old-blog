## Overview

Using M+, customers can create online loan applications, check loan processing progress without going directly to the bank. M+ technology also provides tools to estimate the loan ability and payable amount per month, helping customers preview the content of credit contracts and a list of papers to sign before going to the bank for the disbursement process. These have helped alleviate the fear of cumbersome, time-consuming, and labour-consuming procedures of customers who need to approach a home loan package.

One of the outstanding advantages of the project is that it enhances transparency in the loan process, helping customers proactively grasp the progress of loan processing documents throughout the loan journey with the feature "Smart tracking" on the loan management system.

The M+ project also helps young and dynamic customers familiar with the use of technology applications, can apply and review contracts with just a few clicks, right in the comfort of home or even while on business trips or travelling. The M+ project also offers smarter options, when it comes to calculating eligible loan limits and monthly payments with spreadsheets on the website.

All steps, from filling out loan applications, evaluating credit, drafting contracts and disbursing, are "digitized", saving a lot of time and effort for customers.
