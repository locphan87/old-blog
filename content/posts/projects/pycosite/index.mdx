## Overview

This project aims to rebuild the Pyco Website in order to apply the new online identity of PYCOGROUP.
The top management has particularly insisted on:

- A mobile first approach

- The new site should be used to communicate the Pyco Consulting Job Offer

## Tech Stack

- Back-end: Java, Magnolia
- Front-end: HTML5, CSS3, Responsive Design, SASS, Foundation, JavaScript

## Highlights

The project has been underway for a while before I joined. This is a user interface-oriented project and requires **pixel-perfect** to be achieved.
The demos were successful in overall but later minor UI bugs were found on several devices.
Therefore, we have yet to get the approval to go live.

Fixing these bugs on one device may have negative consequences on the other.
There were times when everything was perfect, then someone introduced a new device and the web page did not render as expected on that device. The average number of defects per day is **20**, the number of tickets has exceeded **1000**.
We fell into a non-stop loop.

After a while, we gathered everyone together in one room (we called it the **war room**) with the determination to thoroughly solve the problems.

> The funny thing is that sometimes we think of ourselves as animals locked in a zoo.

And I decided to completely rebuild the frontend by introducing a new styling approach to support Responsive design and make it more maintainable.

After nearly 2 months of team effort, the project lead finally approved to launch the project.
